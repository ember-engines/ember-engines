/**
 * The `<LazyMount>` component works similar to the
 * [`{{mount}}` helper](https://emberjs.com/api/ember/3.5/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/mount?anchor=mount).
 *
 * It accepts the name of the engine as a positional parameter and also an
 * optional `@model` parameter.
 *
 * As soon as the helper is rendered, it will begin loading the specified
 * engine. If the engine is already loaded, it will be mounted immediately.
 *
 * The `@name` and `@model` parameters are dynamic and you can update them.
 * Setting a new `engineName` will cause the new engine to be loaded and mounted.
 *
 * #### Inline Usage
 *
 * While the engine is loading, nothing is rendered. If there was an error
 * loading the engine, nothing is rendered.
 *
 * ```hbs
 * <LazyMount @name={{engineName}} @model={{optionalDataForTheEngine}}/>
 * ```
 *
 * #### Block Usage
 *
 * While the engine is loading or if there was an error loading the engine, the
 * block that is passed to the component is rendered. The `engine` has two named
 * blocks:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * <LazyMount @name={{engineName}} @model={{optionalDataForTheEngine}}>
 *   <:loading>
 *     ðŸ•‘ The engine is loading...
 *   </:loading>
 *
 *   <:error as |err|>
 *     ðŸ˜¨ There was an error loading the engine:
 *     <code>{{err}}</code>
 *   </:error>
 * </LazyMount>
 * ```
 *
 * When the engine was loaded successfully, the passed in block is replaced by
 * the engine.
 *
 * @class LazyMount
 * @param {string} name Name of the engine to mount.
 * @param {any} [model] Object that will be set as
 *                      the model of the engine.
 * @public
