/**
 * For a given engine, this finds the lowest common ancestor that is considered a
 * host amongst _all_ engines by the same name in the project.
 *
 * For example, given the following project addon structure:
 *
 *      --Project--
 *       /      \
 *      /        \
 * Lazy Engine A  \
 *              Addon A
 *                |
 *                |
 *           Lazy Engine B
 *            /          \
 *           /            \
 *      Lazy Engine A   Lazy Engine C
 *
 * - The LCA host for Lazy Engine A is the app
 * - The LCA host for Lazy Engine B is the app
 * - The LCA host for Lazy Engine C is Lazy Engine B
 *
 * Some context:
 *
 * The reason for this logic is that we want the host addons for deduplication
 * purposes to always be the same, no matter which lazy engine you encounter.
 * For instance, if we encounter Lazy Engine A at level 3 we wouldn't want its
 * actual hosts host to determine which addons to dedupe; you could run into
 * bugs whereby loading lazy engine A via the project won't actually load the
 * expected assets & its bundle was created based on deduplication from invalid
 * host addons.
 *
 * The way this is computed is:
 *
 * - Find all engines by the same name in the project
 * - Compute each of their levels (distances from root project)
 * - From the above levels, get the minimum level
 * - Bring all engines up to the same level (traverse up parent until all levels
 *   are equal)
 * - Check if the parent is strictly equal for all engines at this level and is
 *   considered a host; if this criteria is true return the parent (or the app for
 *   top-level project addons), otherwise traverse upward to the parent for each &
 *   try again
 *
 * @name findLCAHost
 * @param {AddonEngine} engine
 * @returns {Addon|Project}
